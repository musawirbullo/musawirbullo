ðŸ‘‹Hey there! 

Let me introduce myself first, My name is Musawir Bullo; I was born and raised in Pakistan, given an abitition of being a cowboy. My life experiences are very "turny". 
Loving Computer Science started off as a fantasy and then possibly dreaming about becoming the best Software Developer. 


---> I'm a full time Software developer. Currently Engaged in JAVA & Python. Learning many new and up to date languages so that my generation doesn't laugh at me :D


---> My experiences are that I started off as creating Hack Tools/MODS for community gamers. Some 2d games too.


---> I'm currently calling myself a learner and will not conclude myself as an expert. Count that as an honesty perk :D


---> I'm collaborating with Python and C programmers for my upcoming game that I'm working on. 


---> On my git, you will find some programs that I built so far.
